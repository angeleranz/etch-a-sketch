# Etch-a-Sketch
This project is part of the Odin Project Curriculum, it is a browser version of something between a sketchpad and an Etch-A-Sketch.

This was a very fun and interesing way of practicing my skills manipulating the DOM and styling the web page. This certainly was a milestone in my learning foundations of Javascript as well.

## Functionalities

- Paint the board just by hovering your mouse
- Use the color black to do so, or maybe something more colourful, like random colors
- Change the grid size so you can make your paintings in a higher resolution
- Got something wrong? Just erase it
- Got a lot of things wrong? Just reset it
